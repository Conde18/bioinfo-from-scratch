# Bioinfo from scratch
By: Albert Tafur Rangel, a computational biologist


## Introduction

This repository aims to provide a structured and progressive learning pathway for students and young researchers interested in bioinformatics. Starting from the very basics (programming, Linux, Git/GitHub) and gradually advancing towards applied bioinformatics topics, it serves as both a self-learning resource and a teaching companion.

### Target Audience

Undergraduate students in Microbiology, Biology, Biotechnology, and related fields.
Members of research seedbeds and early-career researchers who are new to programming and bioinformatics.
Anyone interested in learning bioinformatics from scratch in a hands-on way.

## Minimum Requirements
No prior knowledge is required. Students only need:
- A computer with internet access.
- Willingness to learn step by step.
- (Optional but recommended) A Linux-based environment or virtual machine, which will be introduced during the course.

## Suggested Learning Pathway

Getting Started → what is bioinformatics, how to use this repository, setting up the environment.
First Steps with Git and GitHub → basic commands, creating and sharing repositories.
Introduction to Linux → navigating the terminal, managing files, running commands.
Python Fundamentals → variables, loops, functions, and handling simple data.
Data Handling in Bioinformatics → working with CSV, FASTA, and tabular formats.
Classical Bioinformatics Tools → sequence alignment, BLAST, annotation basics.
Omics Data Analysis → introduction to genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics.
Networks and Modeling → pathways, metabolic networks, and systems biology concepts.
